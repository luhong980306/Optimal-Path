# Find the closest common ancestor (solution1)    
You are to find the closest common ancestor of two vertices in a binary tree. For example, 
the common ancestors of vertices 8 and 13 in the figure below are vertices 3 and 1. 
Among them, vertex 3 is the closest to the vertex 8 and 13. 
And the size of sub-tree (the number of vertices in the sub-tree) rooted by vertex 3 is 8
    
# Optimal-Path (solution2)
Mr. Kim has to deliver refrigerators to N customers. From the office, he is going to visit all the customers and then return to his home. Each location of the office, his home, and the customers is given in the form of integer coordinates (x,y) (0≤x≤100, 0≤y≤100) . The distance between two arbitrary locations (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is computed by |x1-x2| + |y1-y2|, where |x| denotes the absolute value of x; for instance, |3|=|-3|=3. The locations of the office, his home, and the customers are all distinct. You should plan an optimal way to visit all the N customers and return to his among all the possibilities.
